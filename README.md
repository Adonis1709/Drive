## üìÄ Installation

### Release page

### For MacOS/Linux users with Homebrew + Homebrew Cask

This method is highly recommended for users who want the latest release without the hassle of downloading the executable each time. Learn more about how to get [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/) and [`homebrew-cask`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask).

The following script will install `G Desktop Suite.app` into your `Applications/` folder.

```sh
brew cask install g-desktop-suite
```

Run `brew cask upgrade` to get the latest version of the app.

### For Arch Linux and related distributions

Install the AUR package [`g-desktop-suite-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/g-desktop-suite-git/). Below is an example with [`yay`](https://github.com/Jguer/yay), but any AUR manager will work.

```sh
yay -S g-desktop-suite-git
```
